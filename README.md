# Your Circle Insurance App
Creating a mock health insurance app for practice for a startup idea I had. It is a browser based app made with Python/Django and Python, with full CRUD capability. When fully developed, it will allow customers to cover their entire immediate families with great health insurance.

## Features


## Installation

It isn't deployed yet, but I plan to host it on my own company website if everything comes together in the future. However, for now it will be deployed on Heroku or Github Pages.

## Thought Process

I've worked in the healthcare field as a pharmacy technician for almost 7 years, and I noticed that all the major health insurance companies are just about 100% profit based. I want to start a health insurance tech company that's focused on helping people.

## Unresolved Problems

I need to improve my React Native skills, get my app deployed, and improve the CSS

## Programming Languages

    - Django
    - Python
    - HTML
    - CSS
